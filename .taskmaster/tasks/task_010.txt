# Title: Create Partnership Integration Layer
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8, 9
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement secure integration bridges with Anduril Lattice, Palantir Gotham, and Microsoft Azure Government Cloud while maintaining air-gap capabilities.
# Details:
Build Anduril Lattice API integration for mesh network situational awareness with real-time data sharing and joint mission planning. Create Palantir Gotham connector for intelligence analysis and pattern recognition with classification-aware data exchange. Implement Microsoft Azure Government Cloud integration for hybrid deployments with FedRAMP High compliance and air-gap fallback capability. Develop secure API bridges maintaining end-to-end encryption, identity verification, and access control across all partnerships. Ensure all integrations support classification levels from UNCLASSIFIED to TOP SECRET with appropriate security controls.

# Test Strategy:
Test partnership integrations with real-world data exchange scenarios maintaining security boundaries. Validate hybrid cloud deployment with air-gap fallback capability under network isolation conditions. Conduct end-to-end encryption verification across all partnership interfaces. Verify classification-aware data sharing with appropriate security controls and audit trail maintenance.
