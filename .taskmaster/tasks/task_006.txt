# Task ID: 6
# Title: Create Multi-Domain Drone Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement comprehensive drone integration supporting DJI Matrice series, Skydio X2D, military sUAS platforms, and ROS2 drone ecosystem with air-gapped operation capabilities.
# Details:
Develop drone-specific adapters for DJI Matrice 300/350 RTK (Mobile SDK + Onboard SDK), Skydio X2D autonomous platform, military sUAS platforms (Anduril Ghost, AeroVironment), and ROS2 generic drone ecosystem (PX4/ArduPilot). Implement AI-enhanced autonomous patrol with threat detection, GPS-denied operations with visual navigation, and secure drone imagery collection with automatic classification. Create multi-domain coordination between ground robots and aerial drones with unified mission planning. Add emergency protocols including lost link procedures, low battery handling, airspace violation response, and controlled crash landing capabilities.

# Test Strategy:
Test autonomous drone missions in GPS-denied environments with visual navigation. Validate multi-domain coordination scenarios combining ground robots and aerial drones. Conduct emergency response testing for all failure modes with <100ms emergency response time. Verify air-gapped drone operations with secure mission planning and execution without network connectivity.
