# Task ID: 6
# Title: Update telemetry constants - Change gemini-cli to alcub3-cli and gemini_cli to alcub3_cli
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Update all telemetry-related constants and configuration values throughout the codebase to replace 'gemini-cli' with 'alcub3-cli' and 'gemini_cli' with 'alcub3_cli' for complete ALCUB3 rebranding.
# Details:
This task involves systematically updating telemetry constants and configuration values across the entire codebase to complete the ALCUB3 rebranding. Key changes include: 1) Search for all instances of 'gemini-cli' and 'gemini_cli' in telemetry configuration files, typically located in /packages/core/src/telemetry/, 2) Update service names, metric names, and trace identifiers from 'gemini-cli' to 'alcub3-cli' and 'gemini_cli' to 'alcub3_cli', 3) Modify OpenTelemetry service name configurations to use 'alcub3-cli' instead of 'gemini-cli', 4) Update any telemetry attribute names that reference the old naming convention, 5) Check for telemetry constants in configuration files like .env, config.json, or TypeScript constant files, 6) Update any telemetry endpoint URLs or service identifiers that might still reference the old naming, 7) Verify that telemetry data collection and reporting systems use the new ALCUB3 naming convention, 8) Update any telemetry-related documentation or comments to reflect the new naming.

# Test Strategy:
Validate the telemetry constants update by: 1) Running a comprehensive text search using 'grep -r "gemini-cli\|gemini_cli" .' to ensure no old references remain in telemetry code, 2) Execute 'npm run build' to verify all telemetry modules compile successfully with the new constants, 3) Run 'npm run preflight' to ensure telemetry functionality works end-to-end with the updated naming, 4) Test telemetry data collection by running the CLI with telemetry enabled and verifying service names appear as 'alcub3-cli' in logs/traces, 5) Check that OpenTelemetry traces and metrics use the correct 'alcub3-cli' service name, 6) Verify any telemetry dashboards or monitoring systems can still receive data with the new naming convention, 7) Test that telemetry configuration files load correctly with the updated constants.
