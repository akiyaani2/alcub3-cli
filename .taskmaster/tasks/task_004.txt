# Task ID: 4
# Title: Build Universal Robotics Interface Foundation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the patent-pending universal robotics interface supporting Boston Dynamics, ROS2, and drone platforms with hardware-agnostic command interface and safety validation.
# Details:
Create universal command interface with hardware-agnostic robotics integration supporting Boston Dynamics Spot SDK, ROS2 ecosystem (Iron Irwini/Jazzy Jalopy), and DJI drone platforms (Mobile SDK 5.0+, Onboard SDK 3.9+). Implement real-time safety interlocks with <50ms emergency response time and defense-grade authentication/authorization for robot control. Build platform-specific adapters: boston-dynamics-adapter.py, ros2-adapter.py, dji-drone-adapter.py with unified API. Create safety validation system with operational boundary enforcement, collision avoidance, and graceful degradation. Support 100+ simultaneous robot platform connections with command authentication and audit trails.

# Test Strategy:
Test hardware-in-the-loop integration with real Boston Dynamics Spot robot achieving <50ms control latency. Validate safety interlocks with 100% emergency stop reliability. Conduct multi-platform coordination tests with heterogeneous robot teams. Verify real-time command and telemetry validation across all supported platforms with 24+ hour continuous operation testing.
