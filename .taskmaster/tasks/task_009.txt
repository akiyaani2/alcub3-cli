# Task ID: 9
# Title: Develop Synthetic Training Platform
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create AI-enhanced tactical training platform using SUMO, JSBSim, and AirSim foundations with realistic scenario generation for A254-019 Army SBIR requirements.
# Details:
Integrate SUMO transportation simulation (Eclipse Public License 2.0) for tactical vehicle movement with AI-enhanced scenario generation. Implement JSBSim flight dynamics (LGPL 2.1) for drone operations simulation with threat-aware modeling and GPS-denied environment simulation. Build Microsoft AirSim integration (MIT License) for autonomous vehicle testing with computer vision AI and sensor data classification. Create tactical data generation engine producing realistic scenarios for DDIL (Denied, Degraded, Intermittent, Limited) environments. Develop geospatial tactical environment generation with classification-aware terrain handling and multi-domain coordination across air-ground-maritime operations.

# Test Strategy:
Validate realistic tactical scenario generation meeting A254-019 Army SBIR requirements. Test AI-enhanced simulation with 1000+ simulated entities and real-time performance. Conduct multi-domain simulation scenarios combining SUMO mobility, JSBSim flight dynamics, and AirSim autonomous systems. Verify classification-aware simulation outputs with automatic data classification and secure handling.
