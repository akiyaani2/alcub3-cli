# Task ID: 3
# Title: Develop Air-Gapped MCP Server Core
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the patent-pending air-gapped Model Context Protocol server with 30+ day offline operation capability, context persistence, and secure transfer protocols.
# Details:
Build air-gapped context persistence engine with AES-256-GCM encrypted local storage and context compression using zstd algorithm. Implement secure transfer protocol for USB/removable media with cryptographic package integrity verification using Ed25519 signatures. Create state reconciliation engine with conflict resolution for divergent offline changes and merge capabilities for multi-user scenarios. Develop transfer package structure (.atpkg format) including manifest.json with checksums, encrypted context data, classified data products, cryptographic signatures, and chain-of-custody logging. Implement <5 second sync time for typical context packages.

# Test Strategy:
Validate 30+ day offline operation without degradation using physical air-gap simulation environment. Test secure transfer packages with zero data integrity failures across connected/air-gapped/transfer simulation networks. Verify context merge and conflict resolution with rollback capability. Conduct electromagnetic isolation testing to ensure no data leakage during offline-to-online transitions.
