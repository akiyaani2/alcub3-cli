# Task ID: 8
# Title: Build Red Team Operations Module
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop the first air-gapped red team platform with cyber effects generation, network reconnaissance, and SOCOM threat emulation capabilities.
# Details:
Create cyber effects generation engine with AI-powered attack scenario creation for realistic red team exercises. Implement automated network discovery and mapping for air-gapped environments with RF system integration for electromagnetic spectrum testing. Build C2 bridge integration with commercial platforms (Cobalt Strike, Metasploit) and SOCOM threat emulation for nation-state attack reproduction. Develop threat scenario database with MITRE ATT&CK framework integration and classification-aware threat data handling. Ensure complete offline operation capability with no internet connectivity requirements and comprehensive audit trails for all red team activities.

# Test Strategy:
Validate air-gapped red team testing scenarios without internet connectivity. Test cyber effects generation with realistic attack simulation achieving security posture improvement metrics. Conduct SOCOM-ready threat emulation scenarios with nation-state attack patterns. Verify integration with existing security testing frameworks while maintaining classification data handling requirements.
