# Task ID: 13
# Title: Implement Universal Robotics Security Framework
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop patent-pending Universal Security HAL for heterogeneous robotics platforms with MAESTRO L1-L3 integration and defense-grade classification handling.
# Details:
Build Universal Security Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) providing unified security interface for Boston Dynamics Spot, ROS2, DJI drones, and generic robotics platforms. Implement classification-aware robotics command validation with UNCLASSIFIED through TOP SECRET handling. Create real-time security state synchronization across robot fleets with <50ms emergency stop capability. Develop platform-specific security adapters for major robotics platforms with comprehensive MAESTRO integration. Build unified command and control interface for multi-platform robot fleet management.

# Test Strategy:
Validate <100ms command validation latency across all supported platforms. Test fleet-wide emergency stop achieving <50ms response time. Conduct security validation with 100% classification inheritance accuracy. Verify platform adapter compatibility with real hardware integration testing. Validate unified C2 interface with multi-platform robot coordination scenarios.
