# Task ID: 5
# Title: Update README.md - Rebrand from Gemini CLI to ALCUB3 CLI
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Comprehensively update the README.md file to rebrand from Google's Gemini CLI to ALCUB3 CLI while preserving all functional accuracy and technical details.
# Details:
This task involves a complete rebranding of the main README.md file to reflect ALCUB3's defense-grade AI integration platform while maintaining technical accuracy. Key changes include: 1) Replace all instances of 'Gemini CLI' with 'ALCUB3 CLI' throughout the document, 2) Update the project description to emphasize ALCUB3's defense-grade capabilities, air-gapped operations, and universal system interoperability, 3) Change installation commands from 'npm install -g @google/gemini-cli' to 'npm install -g @alcub3/alcub3-cli', 4) Update all CLI command examples from 'gemini' to 'alcub3' (e.g., 'gemini --help' becomes 'alcub3 --help'), 5) Modify repository URLs, badges, and links to point to ALCUB3 repositories instead of Google's, 6) Update Docker commands to use ALCUB3 registry references, 7) Add ALCUB3-specific features like MAESTRO security framework, air-gap MCP implementation, and universal robotics interface to the feature list, 8) Update contributing guidelines to reflect ALCUB3's security-first development approach, 9) Ensure all code examples, configuration snippets, and API references use the new ALCUB3 branding consistently, 10) Update any Google-specific authentication or API references to reflect ALCUB3's implementation.

# Test Strategy:
Validate the README.md rebranding by: 1) Performing a comprehensive text search to ensure no 'Gemini CLI' references remain except in historical context, 2) Verify all installation commands are updated to use '@alcub3/alcub3-cli' package name, 3) Check that all CLI command examples use 'alcub3' instead of 'gemini', 4) Test that all repository URLs and links are accessible and point to correct ALCUB3 resources, 5) Validate that Docker commands reference correct ALCUB3 registry, 6) Ensure markdown formatting is preserved and renders correctly, 7) Verify technical accuracy by cross-referencing with CLAUDE.md and alcub3_PRD.md for consistency, 8) Check that new ALCUB3-specific features are accurately described and aligned with the security-first architecture, 9) Confirm that the rebranded README maintains the same level of technical detail and usability as the original.
