# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement Defense-Grade CLI Commands
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop comprehensive CLI command set with classification-aware operations, security controls, and robotics integration commands following defense requirements.
# Details:
Extend existing CLI with defense-specific commands: 'alcub3 security audit' (MAESTRO compliance check), 'alcub3 classify [file] --level=[u|s|ts]' (data classification), 'alcub3 airgap package/sync' (air-gap operations), 'alcub3 robotics list/test/emergency-stop' (robot control), 'alcub3 compliance check [stig|maestro|fisma]' (compliance validation). Implement classification-aware command parsing with automatic security validation. Add PKI/CAC authentication integration with role-based access control. Create comprehensive help system with classification-appropriate documentation. Ensure all commands support audit logging and security event reporting.

# Test Strategy:
Validate all CLI commands execute within <500ms for 95% of operations. Test classification-aware operations across UNCLASSIFIED/SECRET/TOP SECRET levels. Verify PKI/CAC authentication integration with defense credentials. Conduct usability testing with defense contractor personnel to ensure command structure meets operational requirements.
