# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement MAESTRO L4-L7 Advanced Security
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Complete MAESTRO security framework implementation with advanced deployment infrastructure, evaluation systems, compliance automation, and agent ecosystem security.
# Details:
Implement L4 deployment infrastructure with container security hardening, network micro-segmentation, and immutable infrastructure deployment using Kubernetes. Build L5 evaluation and observability with real-time security monitoring achieving <30 second anomaly detection, performance metrics with privacy preservation, and comprehensive tamper-evident logging. Create L6 security and compliance with STIG-compliant system configuration, automated compliance reporting achieving 100% STIG compliance score, and role-based access control with principle of least privilege. Develop L7 agent ecosystem with secure agent discovery, capability verification and attestation, and malicious agent detection with <60 second isolation capability.

# Test Strategy:
Conduct independent security assessment achieving zero container vulnerabilities (Critical/High). Validate 99.9% uptime for monitoring systems with real-time anomaly detection. Test automated compliance report generation with 100% STIG compliance maintenance. Verify complete agent attestation before system integration with ecosystem health monitoring.
