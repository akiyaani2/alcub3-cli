        "details": "This task involves testing the end-to-end integration between Task Master and Claude Code by creating a simple development task and observing the complete workflow. Steps include: 1) Access the Task Master interface and create a new task with basic requirements (e.g., 'Add a hello world function to utils.ts'), 2) Submit the task and monitor how it's transmitted to Claude Code, 3) Observe Claude Code's task processing including task parsing, file discovery, and code generation, 4) Verify the generated code meets the task requirements, 5) Check that the task status is properly updated in Task Master, 6) Document any communication failures or workflow bottlenecks encountered during the process. This integration test will use the existing Gemini CLI codebase structure and focus on a simple file modification task to minimize variables while thoroughly testing the core integration points.",

Verify: 1) Task creation succeeds in Task Master interface, 2) Claude Code receives and acknowledges the task, 3) Claude Code correctly identifies target file location using file discovery service, 4) Generated function includes proper TypeScript typing and follows project conventions, 5) Code passes lint and build checks (npm run lint, npm run build), 6) Task status updates correctly in Task Master, 7) Integration completes within reasonable time bounds. Test both success and failure scenarios by intentionally creating an invalid task request.",
