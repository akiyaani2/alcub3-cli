2. Detailed Comparison of Existing Frameworks for Agentic AI

Now, let's explore each of these frameworks in detail and see where they excel and, more importantly, where they fall short when applied to the unique challenges of Agentic AI.

2.1 STRIDE: Strengths and Weaknesses for Agentic AI

Overview: STRIDE, developed by Microsoft, categorizes threats into Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, and Elevation of Privilege. It’s a classic approach to threat modeling, and its core categories are still relevant in modern applications.
Strengths: STRIDE provides a solid foundation for identifying common security vulnerabilities relevant to AI agents, such as data tampering or denial-of-service attacks. It's relatively easy to understand and apply, making it a good starting point for many projects.
Weaknesses: While STRIDE is a good starting point, it doesn't address the unique challenges of AI agents, such as adversarial attacks, or risks due to their unpredictable learning and decision-making processes.
Specific AI Gaps: STRIDE lacks the necessary scope to address threats unique to AI, such as adversarial machine learning, data poisoning, and struggles to model the dynamic, autonomous behaviors of AI agents. It does not explicitly consider the impact of multiple AI agents interacting within an ecosystem.
Applicability: STRIDE can be used as a starting point, but it needs significant augmentation to be effective for Agentic AI, requiring added AI-specific categories or adapting existing ones to reflect new risks.
2.2 PASTA: Strengths and Weaknesses for Agentic AI

Overview: PASTA (Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis) is a risk-centric methodology emphasizing understanding the attacker’s perspective. It involves a seven-stage process: Define Objectives, Define Technical Scope, Application Decomposition, Threat Analysis, Vulnerability and Weakness Analysis, Attack Modeling, and Risk and Impact Analysis.
Strengths: PASTA's risk-based approach is valuable for prioritizing threats based on their potential business or mission impact. It encourages analysis of attacker motivation, leading to more comprehensive threat models.
Weaknesses: PASTA is more complex and resource-intensive than some other frameworks. Like STRIDE, it lacks detailed guidance on AI-specific vulnerabilities. Additionally, it is a highly involved process that may not be flexible enough for modern development methodologies.
Specific AI Gaps: While PASTA excels at risk analysis, it doesn't specifically focus on AI vulnerabilities like adversarial attacks, model extraction, or the complexities of autonomous decision-making. It requires extensions to handle unique AI agent risks, such as those related to data poisoning, or the impact of a manipulated goal.
Applicability: PASTA's risk-centric approach is valuable, but it needs careful adaptation to model the specific behavior of AI agents and their associated risks. This might include new risk categories that focus specifically on adversarial ML techniques or the unintended consequences of AI autonomy.
2.3 LINDDUN: Strengths and Weaknesses for Agentic AI

Overview: LINDDUN focuses specifically on privacy threats, categorizing them as Linkability, Identifiability, Non-repudiation, Detectability, Disclosure of information, Unawareness, and Non-compliance.
Strengths: LINDDUN’s strong focus on privacy is crucial, as AI agents often process personal data, leading to significant privacy implications. It provides a systematic way to identify and analyze privacy risks.
Weaknesses: LINDDUN is primarily focused on privacy, neglecting other critical security threats, and it only partially considers how independent AI decision-making impacts privacy.
Specific AI Gaps: LINDDUN’s narrow scope means it does not cover other essential security threats in Agentic AI, such as data poisoning, denial-of-service attacks on AI, or model extraction. It does not model the unique risks arising from the autonomy of AI.
Applicability: LINDDUN is essential for addressing privacy concerns in Agentic AI, but it must be paired with other frameworks to create a comprehensive threat model. To make it more effective, you might consider adding categories that address privacy risks specific to machine learning, like membership inference attacks or the use of differential privacy to protect training data.
2.4 OCTAVE: Strengths and Weaknesses for Agentic AI

Overview: OCTAVE (Operationally Critical Threat, Asset, and Vulnerability Evaluation) is a risk management framework that focuses on organizational risks. It uses a three-phase process of building asset-based threat profiles, identifying infrastructure vulnerabilities, and developing security strategies and plans.
Strengths: OCTAVE helps align security efforts with the organization's overall risk management strategy and also emphasizes the identification of critical assets, which can include AI agents and the data they rely on.
Weaknesses: Its high-level approach lacks the specific detail needed for modeling the unique threats and vulnerabilities of AI agents. It also requires a well-structured risk management system to function effectively.
Specific AI Gaps: OCTAVE’s broad focus on organizational risk means it lacks the necessary detail to address AI-specific challenges such as adversarial examples or data poisoning. It will need to be extended with categories that consider the unique risks of AI agents, such as the impact of malicious training data or attacks on the learning process.
Applicability: OCTAVE is useful for establishing a high-level risk management framework for AI, but it needs significant modifications to address the nuances of Agentic AI. This could be achieved by adding a layer of risk analysis specifically targeted at AI threats.
2.5 Trike: Strengths and Weaknesses for Agentic AI

Overview: Trike uses a "requirements model" to identify stakeholders, assets, and allowed actions, then combines it with an "implementation model" and data flow diagrams to identify threats and assign risks.
Strengths: It provides a structured way to model the system and its components, and it integrates a risk assessment process to prioritize threats, making it a more complete method than some.
Weaknesses: Trike is fairly complex to implement, especially for large and complex systems, and, similar to the others, it lacks a specific focus on threats unique to AI agents.
Specific AI Gaps: While good for modeling the environment in which AI operates, Trike does not address the internal agent vulnerabilities such as adversarial inputs, data poisoning, or the emergent behaviors that come with learning and autonomy.
Applicability: Trike can be used to model the overall environment that the agent operates within, but needs substantial modifications to effectively include the agents internal workings and risks. This could include detailed modeling of AI data flows or AI model parameter flows within the system.
2.6 VAST: Strengths and Weaknesses for Agentic AI

Overview: VAST (Visual, Agile, and Simple Threat Modeling) emphasizes automation and integrates directly with development workflows, using process flow diagrams to model applications and identify threats.
Strengths: It aligns well with iterative AI development cycles with its emphasis on agile techniques, and its ability to integrate with development tools is useful for continuous security monitoring.
Weaknesses: Its simplicity can limit it for modeling the complex interactions of AI agents, and it also lacks specific guidance on AI-specific threats and vulnerabilities.
Specific AI Gaps: VAST’s focus on agile and iterative development does not adequately model the specific risks of AI such as adversarial machine learning, or emergent properties of autonomous agents. It also needs to be more suited to handling the non-deterministic nature of many AI agents.
Applicability: VAST's strengths in automation can be leveraged, but it will need substantial customization to address the nuances of Agentic AI. This would involve specific extensions to address the intricacies of AI threats, and to integrate specific AI security tooling.
2.7. Gaps in Existing Frameworks for Agentic AI: What's Missing?

Existing frameworks, while useful in many areas, leave significant gaps for Agentic AI. They don't adequately address the unique challenges arising from the autonomy, learning, and interactive nature of these systems.

Autonomy-Related Gaps:

Agent Unpredictability: Traditional frameworks struggle to model the unpredictable actions of autonomous agents. It's difficult to anticipate threats arising from their independent decision-making.
Goal Misalignment: Frameworks often don't cover threats related to an agent's goals becoming misaligned with the intended purpose. This can lead to harmful unintended consequences. For example, an AI stock trading agent corrupted might maximize losses instead of gains.
Machine Learning-Specific Gaps:

Adversarial Machine Learning: Frameworks lack specific guidance on attacks targeting machine learning models.
Data Poisoning: Manipulating training data to corrupt the agent's behavior. For example, injecting malicious data into a self-driving car's training set to make it misidentify stop signs.
Evasion Attacks: Crafting inputs designed to fool an agent. Imagine an image recognition system fooled by adversarial stickers placed on stop signs.
Model Extraction: Stealing an agent's underlying model through API queries. An attacker might want to get a copy of a valuable commercial AI model for their own use.
Lack of Robustness: Frameworks fail to capture the lack of robustness of AI against unexpected or malformed inputs, which could cause unpredictable and potentially harmful behavior
Interaction-Based Gaps:

Agent-to-Agent Interactions: Dynamic interactions between multiple agents are not well-addressed, including risks like:
Collusion: Agents secretly coordinating to achieve malicious goals. For example, multiple AI's working in a market to manipulate prices.
Competition: Agents exploiting each other’s weaknesses in a competitive environment, where agents competing to optimize for resources inadvertently create a harmful outcome.
System-Level Gaps:

Explainability and Auditability: The lack of transparency in complex AI makes it difficult to find the root cause of incidents or audit an agent's behavior for compliance.
Supply Chain Security: AI agents rely on external components, datasets, and models. Frameworks must address risks from:
Compromised pre-trained models.
Vulnerabilities in ML libraries.
Lack of provenance tracking for training data. 3. A Proposed Threat Modeling Framework: MAESTRO

To fill these gaps, we introduce MAESTRO (Multi-Agent Environment, Security, Threat Risk, and Outcome), a framework built for Agentic AI. It's based on the following key principles.

3.1 MAESTRO’s Principles

Extended Security Categories: We're expanding traditional categories like STRIDE, PASTA, and LINDDUN with AI-specific considerations. For example:
Multi-Agent and Environment Focus: Explicitly considering the interactions between agents and their environment. A self-driving car must be aware of other cars, objects, and weather conditions.
Layered Security: Security isn't a single layer, but a property that must be built into each layer of the agentic architecture.
AI-Specific Threats: Addressing threats arising from AI, especially adversarial ML and autonomy-related risks.
Risk-Based Approach: Prioritizing threats based on likelihood and impact within the agent's context.
Continuous Monitoring and Adaptation: Ongoing monitoring, threat intelligence, and model updates to address the evolving nature of AI and threats.
3.2 MAESTRO’s Elements

MAESTRO is built around a seven-layer reference architecture described by Ken Huang, allowing us to understand and address risks at a granular level.

Please see more details about the seven-layer reference architecture here.

Figure 1 gives a mindmap of the reference architecture.

7 Layer Reference Architecture for Agentic AI

Figure 1: 7 Layer Reference Architecture for Agentic AI

This layered approach decomposes the complex AI agent ecosystem into distinct functional layers: from Foundation Models that provide core AI capabilities, through Data Operations and Agent Frameworks that manage information and development tools, to Deployment Infrastructure and Security layers that ensure reliable and safe operations, culminating in the Agent Ecosystem where business applications deliver value to end-users. Each layer serves a specific purpose while abstracting complexity from the layers above it, enabling modular development, clear separation of concerns, and systematic implementation of AI agent systems across organizations.

Reprogramming Attacks: Repurposing the AI model for a malicious task different from its original intent, manipulating the model for unexpected and harmful uses.
B. Cross-Layer Threats

These threats span multiple layers, exploiting interactions between them. For example an attacker might exploit a vulnerability in the container infrastructure (Layer 4) and gain access to a running AI agent instance. From here, they could then leverage this level of access to inject malicious data into the agent's data store (Layer 2), which would then poison the next model update, compromising the foundational model (Layer 1).

Supply Chain Attacks: Compromising a component in one layer (e.g., a library in Layer 3) to affect other layers (e.g., the Agent Ecosystem).
Lateral Movement: An attacker gaining access to one layer (e.g., Layer 4) and then using that access to compromise other layers (e.g., Data Operations).
Privilege Escalation: An agent or attacker gaining unauthorized privileges in one layer, and using it to access or manipulate others.
Data Leakage: Sensitive data from one layer being exposed through another layer.
Goal Misalignment Cascades: Goal misalignment in one agent (e.g., due to data poisoning in Layer 2) that can propagate to other agents through interactions in the Agent Ecosystem.
C. Mitigation Strategies

Mitigations: Data sanitization, and strong validation of training data that are used by the AI systems.
Conclusion

MAESTRO emphasizes a holistic, multi-layered approach to security, acknowledging that protecting Agentic AI systems requires combining traditional cybersecurity, AI-specific controls, and ongoing monitoring. It's not a one time fix, but an iterative process. We encourage you to start using MAESTRO, contribute to its development, and share your findings, as we collectively work towards safer and more secure Agentic AI.
