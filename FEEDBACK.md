## Task ID 3: Develop Air-Gapped MCP Server Core - Work Status

**No subtasks have been completed yet** for Task ID 3. All subtasks are currently "pending".

### Recommendation for Task ID 3:

*   Initiate work on foundational subtasks (e.g., architectural design, encrypted local storage) given its high priority and patent-pending nature.
