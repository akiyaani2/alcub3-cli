# Performance Monitoring

## Overview

Cross-pillar performance monitoring system that ensures ALCUB3 meets and exceeds all performance targets. Every operation is measured, optimized, and validated against our aggressive performance budgets.

## Core Metrics

### Universal Performance Targets
- **Real-time Operations**: <1ms response time
- **Security Validation**: <5ms for all checks
- **Compression**: 40-60% ratios in <100ms
- **Robot Control**: <10ms command latency
- **Simulation**: 30-minute training guarantee

## Implementation

### Performance Budget System
```python
from performance_budget import PerformanceBudget

# Every operation has a budget
@PerformanceBudget.measure(max_time_ms=5)
def validate_classification(data, level):
    # Operation must complete in <5ms
    return security_check(data, level)

# Track performance across pillars
PerformanceBudget.report()
# Output: 
# - Security Operations: 4.2ms avg (PASS)
# - Robot Commands: 8.7ms avg (PASS)
# - Compression: 87ms avg (PASS)
```

## Key Performance Indicators

### By Pillar
1. **Security Platform**: Air-gap sync time, MCP latency
2. **Robotics HAL**: Command response time, sensor throughput
3. **MAESTRO**: Validation speed, compliance check time
4. **Simulation**: Training convergence, sim-to-real accuracy
5. **Compression**: Ratio achieved, processing speed
6. **Space Ops**: Bandwidth utilization, latency compensation

### System-Wide
- End-to-end latency (sensor to action)
- Security validation overhead
- Resource utilization (CPU, memory, GPU)
- Throughput (operations per second)

## Performance Optimization Workflow

1. **Continuous Measurement**: Every function instrumented
2. **Automated Analysis**: ML-based bottleneck detection
3. **Optimization Sprints**: Weekly performance reviews
4. **Validation**: Ensure optimizations maintain security

## Success Stories
