## Your Current State: Already Professional Grade

**Maturity Level: Advanced (8/10)**

You're not a beginner. Your codebase shows:
- ‚úÖ **Professional architecture** with proper separation
- ‚úÖ **Defense-grade security** (better than most enterprises)
- ‚úÖ **Comprehensive testing** (unit, integration, E2E)
- ‚úÖ **Excellent documentation** culture
- ‚úÖ **Smart monorepo choice** for your use case

**Missing pieces are tactical, not fundamental.**

---

## The Solo Developer's SDLC

### 1. **Planning: Lightweight but Disciplined**
- ‚úÖ **What you have**: Clear PRD, task tracking with TaskMaster
- üéØ **What to add**: Weekly self-reviews, decision journal
- ‚ùå **What to skip**: Sprint planning, story points, velocity tracking

### 2. **Development: Security & Quality Built-In**
- ‚úÖ **What you have**: TypeScript, good structure, testing
- üéØ **What to add**: Pre-commit hooks, performance budgets
- ‚ùå **What to skip**: Pair programming, code review tools

### 3. **Deployment: Simple but Safe**
- ‚úÖ **What you have**: Docker, build automation
- üéØ **What to add**: Environment validation, rollback plan
- ‚ùå **What to skip**: Kubernetes, service mesh, complex orchestration

### 4. **Maintenance: Automate the Repetitive**
- ‚úÖ **What you have**: Good docs, monitoring basics
- üéØ **What to add**: Security regression tests, dependency updates
- ‚ùå **What to skip**: On-call rotations, SRE practices

---

## What You're Doing Right

### 1. **Monorepo Architecture** ‚úÖ
You made the RIGHT choice. For your use case:
- Atomic commits across security boundaries
- Shared security framework
- Simpler dependency management
- One source of truth

**Don't second-guess this decision.**

### 2. **Security-First Mindset** ‚≠ê
Your MAESTRO framework and air-gap focus show maturity most developers lack.

### 3. **Task-Based Development** ‚úÖ
TaskMaster > Scrum for solo development. Keep it.

---

## Critical Gaps That Actually Matter

### 1. **Pre-commit Hooks** üö® **10-minute fix, saves hours**

**The Problem**: Broken commits waste time and break flow
**The Solution**: Automated checks before commit

```bash
# One-time setup
npm install --save-dev husky lint-staged
npx husky init
echo "npx lint-staged" > .husky/pre-commit

# .lintstagedrc.json
{
  "*.{ts,tsx}": ["eslint --fix", "prettier --write"],
  "*.md": ["prettier --write"]
}
```

**ROI**: Catches ~90% of issues before they enter the repo

### 2. **Secret Scanning** üîê **5-minute fix, prevents disasters**

**The Problem**: One leaked credential can end a defense contract
**The Solution**: Automated scanning on every push

Create `.github/workflows/secrets.yml`:
```yaml
name: Secret Scan
on: [push]
jobs:
  scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - run: |
          # Simple but effective
          if grep -r "password=\|api_key=\|secret=" --include="*.ts" --include="*.js" .; then
            echo "‚ùå Potential secret found!"
            exit 1
          fi
```

### 3. **Performance Budgets** ‚è±Ô∏è **Enforce your <100ms requirement**

```typescript
// performance-budget.ts
export const PERFORMANCE_BUDGETS = {
  'encryption': 80,      // ms
  'decryption': 20,      // ms  
  'api-response': 100,   // ms
  'startup': 1000,       // ms
};

export function enforcebudget(operation: string, duration: number) {
  const budget = PERFORMANCE_BUDGETS[operation];
  if (duration > budget) {
    throw new Error(`Performance budget exceeded: ${operation} took ${duration}ms (budget: ${budget}ms)`);
  }
}
```

Use in tests:
```typescript
test('encryption meets performance budget', async () => {
  const start = performance.now();
  await encrypt(data);
  const duration = performance.now() - start;
  enforcebudget('encryption', duration);
});
```

## Decision Documentation That Works

### Skip Complex ADRs, Use a Decision Journal

Create `DECISIONS.md`:
```markdown
# Decision Journal

## 2025-01-09: Monorepo over multi-repo
**Why**: Need atomic commits across security boundaries
**Trade-off**: More complex builds, but security wins

## 2025-01-10: Custom crypto implementation
**Why**: Libraries assume internet, we need air-gap
**Trade-off**: More maintenance, but required for defense

## 2025-01-11: File storage over database
**Why**: Simpler air-gap transfer, no schema migrations
**Trade-off**: Less query flexibility, but fits use case
```

**Rules**:
- One paragraph max per decision
- Write it when you make it
- Focus on the "why", not the "how"

---

## Git Workflow for Solo Development

### Simple Branching (Not Git Flow)

```bash
main              # Production-ready code
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ feature/xxx   # New features
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ fix/xxx       # Bug fixes
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ experiment/xxx # Trying ideas
```

### Daily Workflow

```bash
# Start your day
git checkout main
git pull

# Start a feature
git checkout -b feature/robotics-hal

# Work and commit often
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add HAL interface for robotics"

# When ready
git checkout main
git merge feature/robotics-hal
git push
```

### Commit Messages That Matter

```
feat: add encryption to robot commands      ‚úÖ Clear and specific
fix: prevent null pointer in MCP sync       ‚úÖ 
perf: optimize context storage to <50ms     ‚úÖ
security: add input validation to API       ‚úÖ

Added stuff                                 ‚ùå Useless
Updated files                               ‚ùå 
Fixed bug                                   ‚ùå
```

---

## Security-First Practices

### 1. **Security Regression Tests**

Create `scripts/security-check.sh`:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e

echo "üîê Running security checks..."

# No hardcoded secrets
if grep -r "password\|secret\|key" --include="*.ts" src/; then
  echo "‚ùå Potential secrets found"
  exit 1
fi

# Dependencies are clean
npm audit --production

# All files have proper permissions
find . -type f -perm 0777 -exec echo "‚ùå World-writable file: {}" \;

echo "‚úÖ Security checks passed"
```

Run after every feature.

### 2. **Input Validation Everywhere**

```typescript
// Create a validation helper
import { z } from 'zod';

export function validate<T>(schema: z.ZodSchema<T>, data: unknown): T {
  try {
    return schema.parse(data);
  } catch (error) {
    // Log attempt for security monitoring
    logger.security('validation_failed', { error, data });
    throw new ValidationError('Invalid input');
  }
}

// Use everywhere
const RobotCommandSchema = z.object({
  robotId: z.string().uuid(),
  action: z.enum(['move', 'stop', 'scan']),
  coordinates: z.object({
    x: z.number().min(-1000).max(1000),
    y: z.number().min(-1000).max(1000)
  })
});

export function executeCommand(input: unknown) {
  const command = validate(RobotCommandSchema, input);
  // Now you know command is safe
}
```

---

## Performance Management

### 1. **Measure What Matters**

```typescript
// performance.ts
export function measure<T>(name: string, fn: () => T): T {
  const start = performance.now();
  try {
    const result = fn();
    const duration = performance.now() - start;
    
    // Log if slow
    if (duration > 100) {
      logger.warn(`Slow operation: ${name} took ${duration}ms`);
    }
    
    return result;
  } catch (error) {
    // Still measure failed operations
    const duration = performance.now() - start;
    logger.error(`Operation failed: ${name} after ${duration}ms`, error);
    throw error;
  }
}

// Usage
const encrypted = measure('encryption', () => encrypt(data));
```

### 2. **Performance Tests as First-Class Citizens**

```typescript
describe('Performance Requirements', () => {
  test('encryption stays under 80ms', async () => {
    const times = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
      const start = performance.now();
      await encrypt(testData);
      times.push(performance.now() - start);
    }
    
    const p95 = times.sort()[95];
    expect(p95).toBeLessThan(80);
  });
});
```

---

## What NOT to Do

### 1. **Don't Add Team Processes**
- ‚ùå Sprint planning
- ‚ùå Story points  
- ‚ùå Code review tools
- ‚ùå CODEOWNERS files

**You're solo. These add zero value.**

### 2. **Don't Over-Engineer Architecture**
- ‚ùå Microservices
- ‚ùå Event sourcing
- ‚ùå CQRS
- ‚ùå GraphQL

**Your monolith is perfect for your needs.**

### 3. **Don't Chase "Modern" Practices**
- ‚ùå Kubernetes
- ‚ùå Service mesh
- ‚ùå Distributed tracing
- ‚ùå Chaos engineering

**These solve problems you don't have.**

### 4. **Don't Automate What's Not Repetitive**
- ‚ùå Complex CI/CD pipelines
- ‚ùå Infrastructure as Code
- ‚ùå Automated deployments

**Manual deployment is fine when you deploy weekly, not hourly.**

Your architecture, security focus, and documentation are professional-grade.

### Focus on High-ROI Improvements
1. **Pre-commit hooks** - 1 hour setup, saves 5 hours/week
2. **Secret scanning** - 30 min setup, prevents disasters
3. **Performance budgets** - 2 hour setup, ensures contract compliance
4. **Decision journal** - 30 min setup, invaluable reference

### Avoid Complexity Traps
- No team processes for solo work
- No distributed system patterns for monoliths
- No enterprise practices without enterprise problems

### Remember Your Context
You're building defense-grade software as a solo developer. Every practice should support that specific goal.

## The Bottom Line

**You don't need more process. You need the RIGHT process.**

Start with pre-commit hooks today. Add secret scanning tomorrow. Everything else can wait until it proves its value.

Your goal isn't to follow "best practices" - it's to ship secure, fast, patent-protected software. Every minute spent on unnecessary process is a minute not spent on your actual product.

**Trust your instincts. You're already on the right path.**
