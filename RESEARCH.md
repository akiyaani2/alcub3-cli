        self.local_models = self._initialize_local_models()
        self.audit_logger = SecureAuditLogger()

    async def handle_request(self, request: MCPRequest) -> MCPResponse:
        """Handle MCP requests in air-gapped environment."""
        self._validate_security_clearance(request)
        result = await self._process_locally(request)
        self.audit_logger.log_access(request, result)

## 7. Technical Implementation References

### Python Cryptography with FIPS 140-2

**Implementation Approach:**

- No directly FIPS-validated Python packages exist
- pyca/cryptography inherits compliance from OpenSSL 3.0+
- ~20% performance degradation for AES-256-GCM
- Minimal impact on SHA-256 operations

```python
# FIPS-compliant Python configuration
import os
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers import Cipher, algorithms, modes
from cryptography.hazmat.backends import default_backend

def fips_encrypt(data: bytes, key: bytes) -> bytes:
    iv = os.urandom(16)
    cipher = Cipher(algorithms.AES(key), modes.CBC(iv), backend=default_backend())
    encryptor = cipher.encryptor()
    padded_data = data + b' ' * (16 - len(data) % 16)
    ciphertext = encryptor.update(padded_data) + encryptor.finalize()
    return iv + ciphertext
```

### TypeScript/Node.js Security

**FIPS Compilation:**

```bash
# Configure Node.js with FIPS OpenSSL
./configure --openssl-fips=/usr/local/openssl --shared-openssl
make -j$(nproc)
```

**Secure Deployment:**

```javascript
const tlsOptions = {
  ciphers: ['ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384', 'ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256'].join(
    ':',
  ),
  minVersion: 'TLSv1.2',
  maxVersion: 'TLSv1.3',
};
```

### Rust Cryptographic Operations

**AWS-LC-RS Solution:**

- FIPS 140-3 Level 1 validated
- Drop-in replacement for ring crate
- AES-256-GCM: 2.5 GB/s on Intel x86_64
- ECDSA P-256: 50,000 signatures/second

```rust
use aws_lc_rs::{
    aead::{Aead, AES_256_GCM, LessSafeKey, UnboundKey},
    digest::{digest, SHA256}
};

fn fips_encrypt(plaintext: &[u8], key: &[u8]) -> Result<Vec<u8>, Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let unbound_key = UnboundKey::new(&AES_256_GCM, key)?;
    let sealing_key = LessSafeKey::new(unbound_key);
    // Implementation continues...
}
```

### Container Security Hardening

```yaml
# NSA/CISA Kubernetes hardening
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
spec:
  securityContext:
    runAsNonRoot: true
