# Security Clearance-Based Access Control (CBAC)

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-07-07
**Feature Status:** Implemented & Production-Ready (Task 2.12)

## 1. Overview

The ALCUB3 platform implements a defense-grade Security Clearance-Based Access Control (CBAC) system. This system is designed to meet the stringent access control requirements of the Department of Defense (DoD) and the Intelligence Community (IC). It ensures that users can only access data, tools, and systems that correspond to their verified security clearance level and their role-based permissions.

This system is a core component of the MAESTRO L3 (Agent Framework) and L6 (Security & Compliance) layers, providing the foundational security necessary for multi-level secure operations.

## 2. Core Capabilities

### 2.1. PKI/CAC Authentication

ALCUB3 integrates directly with DoD-standard Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and Common Access Card (CAC) authentication systems.

*   **FIPS 201 Compliant:** The system adheres to the FIPS 201 standard for Personal Identity Verification (PIV).
*   **NIPRNet/SIPRNet Support:** The authentication mechanism is designed to operate seamlessly on both NIPRNet (Non-classified Internet Protocol Router Network) and SIPRNet (Secret Internet Protocol Router Network).
*   **Hardware-Backed Keys:** User authentication leverages the private keys stored securely on the user's CAC, ensuring that authentication is tied to a physical token.

### 2.2. Security Clearance Validation

Upon successful PKI/CAC authentication, the CBAC system validates the user's security clearance.

*   **Multi-Level Security:** The system supports clearance levels from Unclassified up to Top Secret/SCI (Sensitive Compartmented Information).
*   **Compartment Checking:** For SCI-level access, the system can check for specific compartments and caveats, ensuring need-to-know is enforced.
*   **Real-Time Validation:** Clearance information is validated against a trusted authority (e.g., a local security management database) to ensure it is up-to-date.

### 2.3. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

Once authenticated and clearance-validated, the user's actions are governed by their assigned role.

*   **Granular Permissions:** Roles define which specific tools, commands, and data a user is authorized to access.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Users are granted only the minimum permissions necessary to perform their duties.
*   **Example Roles:**
    *   `Robotics_Operator`
    *   `Red_Team_Analyst`
    *   `System_Administrator`
    *   `Auditor`

### 2.4. Hardware Security Module (HSM) Integration

All cryptographic operations that underpin the CBAC system are performed within a FIPS 140-2 Level 3+ compliant Hardware Security Module (HSM).

*   **Secure Key Storage:** The private keys used by the ALCUB3 system itself (e.g., for signing audit logs) are stored securely in the HSM.
*   **Cryptographic Isolation:** The HSM ensures that sensitive cryptographic operations are isolated from the host operating system, protecting them from compromise.

## 3. How it Works: The Authentication & Authorization Flow

1.  **User Initiates Action:** A user attempts to execute a command, e.g., `alcub3 robotics mission create ...`.
2.  **PKI/CAC Challenge:** The ALCUB3 CLI prompts the user to authenticate with their CAC.
3.  **Clearance Validation:** The system validates the user's certificate and checks their clearance level against the required level for the command.
4.  **Role Validation:** The system checks if the user's role (e.g., `Robotics_Operator`) has the necessary permission (`robotics:mission:create`).
5.  **Classification Check:** The system verifies that the mission's specified data classification (e.g., `SECRET`) does not exceed the user's clearance.
6.  **Action Authorized:** If all checks pass, the command is executed.
7.  **Auditing:** The entire transaction is cryptographically signed and recorded in the audit log.

```typescript
// Simplified example of the CBAC logic
async function canExecuteCommand(user: User, command: Command): Promise<boolean> {
    // 1. Authenticate user via CAC
    const isAuthenticated = await pki.authenticate(user.cac);
    if (!isAuthenticated) return false;

    // 2. Check clearance level
    const hasSufficientClearance = clearance.validate(user.clearance, command.requiredClearance);
    if (!hasSufficientClearance) return false;

    // 3. Check role-based permissions
    const isRoleAuthorized = rbac.canPerformAction(user.role, command.requiredPermission);
    if (!isRoleAuthorized) return false;

    // 4. Log and execute
    await audit.log(user, command, "AUTHORIZED");
    return true;
}
```

## 4. Performance

The CBAC system is highly optimized to minimize latency impact on operations.

*   **Authentication & Clearance Validation:** < 50ms
*   **Authorization Checks:** < 25ms

These performance metrics ensure that robust security does not come at the cost of operational tempo.

## 5. Patent-Pending Innovations

The CBAC system includes several patent-pending technologies:

*   **Adaptive Clearance Inheritance:** A mechanism where temporary, task-specific clearances can be granted and inherited based on mission context, with a full audit trail.
*   **Behavioral Analysis:** The system can learn a user's typical behavior and flag or re-authenticate anomalous activity, even if the user is technically authorized.

This combination of compliant, high-performance, and innovative security features makes the ALCUB3 CBAC system a cornerstone of the platform's value proposition for defense and intelligence clients.
