# Security HAL Architecture Design

## Overview
This document will detail the design of the Universal Security Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) for ALCUB3. This HAL will provide a standardized interface for applying MAESTRO security controls across diverse robotics platforms.

## Key Components
- **Universal Security Interface**: A common API for security operations.
- **Platform-Specific Adapters**: Modules for integrating with different robotics platforms (e.g., Boston Dynamics, ROS2, DJI).
- **Classification-Aware Command Validation**: Ensuring commands adhere to data classification policies.
- **Real-Time Security State Synchronization**: Mechanisms for maintaining consistent security posture across the fleet.

## Development Status
