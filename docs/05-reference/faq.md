- Optional: Docker for containerized deployment
- Optional: Hardware Security Module (HSM)

### How do I install ALCUB3?
```bash
git clone https://github.com/alcub3/alcub3-cli.git
cd alcub3-cli
npm install
npm run build
npm start
```

### Can I run ALCUB3 without internet access?
Yes! ALCUB3 is designed for air-gapped operations. Use:
```bash
export ALCUB3_AIRGAP_MODE="true"
alcub3 airgap package --prepare
```

## Security Questions

### Is ALCUB3 approved for classified data?
ALCUB3 implements security controls compliant with:
- STIG V5R1 validation
- NIST SP 800-171 (110 controls)
- FIPS 140-2 Level 3+ cryptography
Always verify with your security officer before processing classified data.

### How does air-gap mode work?
Air-gap mode:
1. Caches AI models locally
2. Disables all network connections
3. Enables offline operation for 30+ days
4. Synchronizes context when reconnected
5. Maintains full audit trail

### What clearance levels are supported?
- UNCLASSIFIED (U)
- CONFIDENTIAL (C) 
- SECRET (S) - Air-gap recommended
- TOP SECRET (TS) - Air-gap required

### How do I report security vulnerabilities?
Email security@alcub3.dev using appropriate classification channels. Follow responsible disclosure guidelines.

## Robotics Integration

### What robotics platforms are supported?
Currently supported:
- Boston Dynamics (Spot, Atlas)
- ROS2/SROS2 systems
- DJI drones (security hardened)
- Universal Robots (UR series)
- Custom platforms via Universal HAL

### How do I connect to a robot?
```bash
# Discover available robots
alcub3 robotics discover

# Connect to specific platform
alcub3 robotics connect --platform=boston-dynamics --id=spot-001

# Verify connection
alcub3 robotics status --id=spot-001
```

### What safety features are included?
- Hardware emergency stop
- Geofencing and no-fly zones
- Physics validation engine
- Byzantine fault tolerance
- <30ms emergency response time

## Performance & Optimization

### How can I improve performance?
1. Increase worker threads: `export ALCUB3_MAX_WORKERS=8`
2. Enable GPU acceleration: `export ALCUB3_GPU_ENABLED=true`
3. Optimize cache size: `export ALCUB3_CACHE_SIZE=1024`
4. Use performance profiling: `alcub3 perf analyze`

### What are the performance benchmarks?
- API response: <100ms (99th percentile)
- Robot command latency: <50ms
- Emergency stop: <30ms
- Model inference: <500ms
- Encryption overhead: <3%

### How much disk space is needed?
- Base installation: 2GB
- Offline model cache: 20-50GB
- Audit logs: 1GB/month
- Robot adapters: 100MB each

## Troubleshooting

### ALCUB3 won't start
1. Check Node.js version: `node --version` (must be 18+)
2. Clear npm cache: `npm cache clean --force`
3. Reinstall dependencies: `npm install`
4. Check permissions: `ls -la ~/.alcub3`

### Authentication fails
1. Verify PKI certificate: `alcub3 auth validate`
2. Check HSM connection: `alcub3 hsm status`
3. Refresh credentials: `alcub3 auth refresh`
4. Contact security admin if persists

### Robot connection drops
1. Check network stability: `alcub3 diagnostics network`
2. Verify robot firmware: `alcub3 robotics info --id=robot-001`
3. Test emergency stop: `alcub3 robotics test-estop`
4. Review security logs: `alcub3 logs --filter=robotics`

### Performance degradation
1. Check system resources: `alcub3 diagnostics system`
2. Clear cache: `alcub3 cache clear`
3. Optimize database: `alcub3 db optimize`
4. Review performance metrics: `alcub3 perf report`

## Compliance & Auditing

### How do I generate compliance reports?
```bash
# STIG compliance report
alcub3 compliance stig --format=pdf

# NIST control validation
alcub3 compliance nist --controls=all

# Custom audit report
alcub3 audit generate --start=2024-01-01 --end=2024-12-31
```

### What logs are maintained?
- Security events (7 year retention)
- API calls (1 year retention)
- Robot commands (90 days)
- Performance metrics (30 days)
- User actions (immutable audit trail)

### How often should I run security scans?
Recommended schedule:
