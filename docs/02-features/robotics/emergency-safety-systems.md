# Emergency Safety Systems

## Overview
The ALCUB3 Universal Emergency Safety System provides defense-grade emergency response and safety override capabilities for robotic platforms. It is designed to ensure ultimate reliability and safety in critical scenarios.

## Key Architectural Decisions
- **Multi-layered Emergency Stop Hierarchy**: Implements a 5-level emergency stop hierarchy (Soft Stop, Hard Stop, Emergency Stop, Failsafe Stop, Destruction) to provide proportional responses to different threat scenarios.
- **Hardware-Level Emergency Stops**: Incorporates hardware interfaces that bypass all software layers, ensuring safety even in the event of software failures.
- **Redundant Safety Systems**: Utilizes triple redundancy (Primary/Secondary/Tertiary) to eliminate single points of failure and ensure high availability (99.999%) for safety-critical operations.
- **Predictive Safety Intervention**: Employs an AI-powered predictive engine for proactive safety measures, aiming to prevent accidents through early intervention.
- **Fail-Safe Defaults**: All systems are designed to default to the safest possible state upon failure (e.g., emergency land on power loss, return to home on communication loss).
- **Comprehensive Audit Logging**: Maintains an immutable audit trail for all safety events and decisions, crucial for post-incident analysis, compliance, and accountability.

## Patent-Defensible Innovations
- Universal emergency protocol across heterogeneous robotics platforms.
- AI-powered predictive safety intervention system.
- Distributed consensus emergency stop with Byzantine fault tolerance.
- Multi-layered safety validation with hardware attestation.
- Dynamic safety zone computation with real-time threat correlation.

## Compliance
- IEC 61508 (SIL 4)
- ISO 26262 (ASIL D)
- MIL-STD-882E
- DO-178C Level A

## Emergency Stop Levels
- `SOFT_STOP`: Controlled deceleration and stop.
- `HARD_STOP`: Immediate motor cutoff.
- `EMERGENCY_STOP`: Hardware-level emergency stop.
- `FAILSAFE_STOP`: Complete power isolation.
- `DESTRUCTION`: Self-destruction (extreme scenarios).

## Core Functionalities
- `registerPlatform(config: EmergencyStopConfig)`: Registers a robotic platform with its emergency stop capabilities and configures safety monitoring.
- `executeEmergencyStop(platformIds: string[], stopLevel: EmergencyStopLevel, reason: string, authority: OverrideAuthority)`: Executes an emergency stop on specified platforms at a given level, with proper authorization.
- `getSafetyAssessment()`: Provides real-time safety assessments for all registered platforms, including active and predicted violations.
- `executeSafetyOverride(override: SafetyOverrideCommand)`: Executes a safety override with proper authorization and impact assessment.
- `activatePredictiveIntervention(platformId: string)`: Activates AI-powered predictive safety intervention for a given platform.

## Configuration (`EmergencyStopConfig`)
- `platformId`: Unique identifier for the platform.
- `platformType`: Type of robotic platform.
- `hardwareStopAvailable`: Indicates if hardware-level stop is available.
- `stopMethods`: Array of available stop methods for the platform.
- `responseTimeMs`: Response time requirements for different emergency levels.
- `safetyZones`: Defined safety zones for the platform.
- `failsafeBehavior`: Defines actions to take on various failures (power loss, communication loss, etc.).
- `redundancyLevel`: Level of redundancy for the platform's safety systems.

## Interfaces and Data Structures
- `EmergencyStopLevel`, `OverridePriority`, `SafetyViolationType`: Enumerations for safety levels, priorities, and violation types.
- `EmergencyStopConfig`, `StopMethod`, `ResponseTimeRequirements`, `FailsafeBehavior`: For configuring emergency stops and failsafe actions.
- `SafetyMonitoringConfig`, `SafetyThresholds`: For configuring safety monitoring and thresholds.
- `SafetyAssessment`, `SafetyLevel`, `SafetyViolation`, `PredictedViolation`, `SafetyAction`, `EmergencyReadiness`: For real-time safety assessment and actions.
- `EmergencyStopResult`, `SafetyOverrideCommand`, `OverrideType`: For emergency stop execution results and manual overrides.
