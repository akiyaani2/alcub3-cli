# ROS2 Security Integration

## Overview
This document will detail the integration of MAESTRO with the ROS2 security architecture (SROS2), providing defense-grade security for ROS2-based robotics systems.

## Key Features
- **Classification-Aware ROS2 Security**: Implementing security policies that respect data classification within ROS2 nodes.
- **SROS2 Policy Enforcement**: Real-time validation and enforcement of SROS2 security policies.
- **ROS2 Emergency Coordination**: Distributed emergency stop mechanisms across ROS2 node networks.
- **ROS2 Node Security Profiles**: Managing security profiles for individual ROS2 nodes.

## Development Status
(Placeholder for future implementation details and code examples.)
