# Unified Robotics C2 Interface

## Overview
This document will detail the development of a single Command and Control (C2) interface for managing all connected robotics platforms within the ALCUB3 ecosystem. This interface will provide real-time security status and unified control capabilities.

## Key Features
- **Centralized Control**: A single point of control for diverse robotics platforms.
- **Real-Time Security Status**: Displays the security posture of all connected robots.
- **Unified Command Execution**: Send commands to individual robots or entire fleets through a consistent interface.
- **Integration with MAESTRO**: Leverages the MAESTRO security framework for all C2 operations.

## Development Status
(Placeholder for future implementation details and UI/CLI design.)
