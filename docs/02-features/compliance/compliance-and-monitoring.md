# Compliance & Monitoring

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-07-07
**Feature Status:** Implemented & Production-Ready (Tasks 2.5, 2.7)

## 1. Overview

The ALCUB3 platform provides a suite of tools for automated compliance validation and real-time security monitoring. These capabilities are essential for maintaining a strong security posture and meeting the stringent requirements of defense and critical infrastructure environments.

This document covers the STIG Compliance Validation System and the Real-Time Security Monitoring & Alerting features.

## 2. STIG Compliance Validation System

The ALCUB3 platform includes an automated system for validating compliance with the Security Technical Implementation Guides (STIGs) from the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA).

*   **Automated Scanning:** The system can automatically scan connected systems to validate compliance with the 32 Category I (critical) security controls from the STIG Application Security and Development (ASD) V5R1.
*   **Real-Time Drift Detection:** The system continuously monitors for configuration changes that would bring a system out of compliance. If a drift is detected, an alert is raised immediately.
*   **Automated Reporting:** The system can generate detailed compliance reports in various formats, providing the documentation needed for audits and accreditations.
*   **Patent-Pending Innovations:** The compliance automation engine includes patent-pending technologies for efficiently and accurately validating compliance in complex, air-gapped environments.

## 3. Real-Time Security Monitoring & Alerting

ALCUB3 implements a sophisticated, real-time security monitoring and alerting system that provides deep visibility into the security posture of the platform and connected systems.

*   **Cross-Layer Event Correlation:** The system collects and correlates security events from all layers of the MAESTRO framework (L1-L7), providing a holistic view of security-relevant activity.
*   **Hardware Entropy Fusion:** The system can fuse entropy from multiple hardware sources (TPM 2.0, Intel RdRand, ARM TrustZone, HSMs) to provide a high-quality source of randomness for cryptographic operations and security monitoring.
*   **Context-Aware Behavioral Anomaly Detection:** The system uses AI to establish a baseline of normal behavior for users, agents, and systems. It can then detect and alert on deviations from this baseline, providing an early warning of potential compromise.
*   **Performance Optimized:** The monitoring and alerting system is highly optimized to minimize its impact on system performance, with typical overheads of less than 50ms for classification, 100ms for integrity checks, and 25ms for authorization.

## 4. Integration with the ALCUB3 Platform

The Compliance & Monitoring features are tightly integrated with the rest of the ALCUB3 platform:

*   **MAESTRO Security Framework:** The monitoring system provides the visibility needed to enforce the policies of the MAESTRO framework. The compliance system validates that the framework is implemented correctly.
*   **Clearance-Based Access Control (CBAC):** The monitoring system logs all access control decisions, providing a detailed audit trail of who accessed what, when, and why.
*   **Cryptography:** The monitoring system uses the platform's cryptographic capabilities to ensure the integrity of its logs and the confidentiality of its communications.

By providing these advanced compliance and monitoring capabilities, ALCUB3 enables organizations to maintain a strong security posture, meet their compliance obligations, and detect and respond to threats in real time.
