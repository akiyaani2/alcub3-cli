## Usage

### 1. Running Compliance Assessment

```python
from security_framework.src.shared.nist_compliance_assessment import (
    NISTPomplianceAssessment, AssessmentType
)

# Initialize assessment engine
assessment_engine = NISTPomplianceAssessment()

# Run full assessment
result = await assessment_engine.run_assessment(
    AssessmentType.FULL,
    system_state={...}  # Current system configuration
)

print(f"Compliance: {result.compliance_percentage:.1f}%")
print(f"Risk Level: {result.risk_level.value}")
```

from security_framework.src.shared.cui_handler import CUIHandler

# Initialize CUI handler
cui_handler = CUIHandler()

# Detect CUI in content
result = await cui_handler.detect_cui(
    "This document contains ITAR controlled technical data"

```

### 3. Gap Analysis & Remediation

```python
# Perform gap analysis
gaps = await assessment_engine.perform_gap_analysis()

# Create remediation plan
