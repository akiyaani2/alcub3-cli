# Real-Time Security Monitoring & Alerting

## Overview
This module provides real-time security monitoring and alerting capabilities for the ALCUB3 platform, focusing on cross-layer threat detection and rapid response.

## Features
- **Cross-Layer Security Event Correlation**: Patent-pending innovations for correlating security events across different layers of the ALCUB3 architecture.
- **Hardware Entropy Fusion**: Supports hardware-based entropy sources like TPM 2.0, Intel RdRand, ARM TrustZone, and HSMs for enhanced randomness.
- **Context-Aware Behavioral Anomaly Detection**: Utilizes adaptive baselining to detect unusual and potentially malicious behavior.
- **Enhanced L2 Data Security**: Implements classification-aware flow control for data at Layer 2.
- **Enhanced L3 Agent Security**: Enforces zero-trust authorization for agents at Layer 3.

## Performance
- Classification: <50ms
- Integrity: <100ms
- Authorization: <25ms

## Implementation Details
