# Prompt Injection Prevention

## Overview
This document will outline the strategies and mechanisms implemented in ALCUB3 to prevent prompt injection attacks, ensuring the integrity and security of AI model interactions.

## Key Features
- **Input Sanitization**: Techniques to clean and validate user inputs before processing by AI models.
- **Context Isolation**: Mechanisms to separate user-provided prompts from internal system instructions.
- **Behavioral Analysis**: Monitoring AI model responses for anomalous behavior indicative of prompt injection.
- **Threat Detection**: Integration with security monitoring systems to detect and alert on potential injection attempts.

## Development Status
(Placeholder for future implementation details and technical specifications.)
