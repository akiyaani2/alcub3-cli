# Air-Gap MCP Server Integration (Phase 4)

## Overview
This document outlines the advanced integration of the Air-Gap Model Context Protocol (MCP) server, focusing on achieving robust offline AI operations and secure model serving infrastructure.

## Key Features
- **Offline Model Context Protocol**: Mechanisms for maintaining and synchronizing AI model context in air-gapped environments for extended periods (30+ days).
- **Secure Model Serving Infrastructure**: Ensuring secure deployment and execution of AI models in isolated networks.
- **Classification-Aware Model Routing**: Dynamically routing AI models based on data classification levels.
- **Optimized Data Transfer**: Efficient and secure transfer of model updates and context across air gaps.

## Development Status
(Placeholder for architecture, implementation details, and performance targets.)
