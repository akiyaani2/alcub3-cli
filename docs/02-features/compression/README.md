# Neural Compression Engine (Pillar 6)

*Documentation coming soon*

## Overview

The Neural Compression Engine, nicknamed "Defense Pied Piper," provides transformer-based compression achieving 40-60% compression ratios while maintaining classification markings and security properties.

## Planned Features

### Transformer-Based Compression
- 40-60% compression ratios
- Lossless for critical data
- Adaptive compression strategies

### Classification-Aware Processing
- Preserves security markings
- Maintains data provenance
- Supports cross-domain transfers

### Universal Data Support
- Works across all ALCUB3 pillars
- Supports structured and unstructured data
- Real-time compression/decompression

### FIPS 140-2 Compliance
- Cryptographically secure algorithms
- Hardware acceleration support
- Validated implementations

### Performance Targets
- <100ms latency for real-time streams
- >1GB/s throughput
- Minimal CPU overhead

## Coming in Q3 2025

This pillar is currently under development. The compression engine will revolutionize how defense systems handle large-scale data.

## Use Cases

- Satellite imagery compression
- Sensor data optimization
- Model weight compression
- Secure data archival
- Bandwidth-limited operations
