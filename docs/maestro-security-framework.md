**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-07-07
**Feature Status:** Implemented & Production-Ready (Task 2.1)

## 1. Overview

The ALCUB3 platform is built on the foundation of the MAESTRO Security Framework, a comprehensive, defense-in-depth approach to securing AI systems. This document provides an overview of the L1-L3 layers of the framework, which are fully implemented in the ALCUB3 core platform.

The MAESTRO framework is designed to provide a holistic security posture, addressing vulnerabilities from the AI model itself to the data it processes and the agents that use it.

## 2. MAESTRO L1: Foundation Models

Layer 1 focuses on securing the AI models at the heart of the system.

*   **Model Input Sanitization:** All inputs to AI models are rigorously sanitized to remove potentially malicious content.
*   **Prompt Injection Prevention:** The system employs multiple techniques to prevent prompt injection attacks, where an attacker attempts to manipulate the AI's output by embedding malicious instructions in the input.
*   **Model Output Filtering:** The output from AI models is filtered to prevent the leakage of sensitive or classified information.
*   **Adversarial Input Detection:** The system is trained to detect and reject inputs that are designed to trick or mislead the AI model (e.g., adversarial examples).

## 3. MAESTRO L2: Data Operations

Layer 2 focuses on securing the data that the AI system processes.

*   **Automatic Data Classification:** ALCUB3's classification-native design automatically classifies data as it is created or ingested, ensuring that it is handled appropriately.
*   **Encrypted Data at Rest:** All data is stored using FIPS 140-2 compliant AES-256-GCM encryption.
*   **Secure Data in Transit:** All data is transmitted using TLS 1.3 and mutual TLS (mTLS) for inter-service communication.
*   **Data Lineage Tracking:** The system maintains a complete, auditable record of data lineage, tracking where data came from, how it has been transformed, and who has accessed it.

## 4. MAESTRO L3: Agent Framework

Layer 3 focuses on securing the agents (both human and machine) that interact with the AI system.

*   **Agent Behavior Validation & Sandboxing:** All agent actions are validated against a set of predefined rules. Potentially dangerous actions are executed in a secure sandbox to prevent them from affecting the host system.
*   **Tool Access Control:** The Clearance-Based Access Control (CBAC) system ensures that agents can only access the tools and commands that are authorized for their clearance level and role.
*   **Inter-Agent Communication Encryption:** All communication between agents is encrypted to prevent eavesdropping and tampering.
*   **Agent State Persistence with Integrity Verification:** The state of each agent is saved securely, with cryptographic signatures to ensure that it has not been tampered with.

## 5. Integration with Other Security Features

The MAESTRO L1-L3 framework is tightly integrated with the other security features of the ALCUB3 platform, including:

*   **Clearance-Based Access Control (CBAC):** Provides the core authentication and authorization for the L3 Agent Framework.
*   **Real-Time Security Monitoring & Alerting:** Provides the visibility and alerting needed to detect and respond to threats at all three layers.
*   **Secure Key Management & Rotation:** Provides the cryptographic foundation for the encryption and data integrity features of the framework.

By implementing the MAESTRO L1-L3 framework, ALCUB3 provides a robust, multi-layered security posture that protects the AI system from a wide range of threats.
