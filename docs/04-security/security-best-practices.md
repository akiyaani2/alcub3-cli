# ALCUB3 Security Best Practices

This guide outlines security best practices for deploying and operating ALCUB3 in defense and critical infrastructure environments.

## Classification Handling

### Data Classification Levels
- **UNCLASSIFIED**: Default level for public information
- **CONFIDENTIAL**: Internal use, limited distribution
- **SECRET**: Requires clearance, secure channels
- **TOP SECRET**: Highest classification, air-gap required

### Best Practices
1. Always verify classification level before processing data
2. Use air-gap mode for SECRET and above
3. Enable audit logging for all classified operations
4. Implement need-to-know access controls

## Air-Gap Operations

### When to Use Air-Gap Mode
- Processing classified data (SECRET and above)
- Operating in contested environments
- Handling critical infrastructure controls
- Extended offline operations (30+ days)

### Air-Gap Configuration
```bash
# Enable air-gap mode
export ALCUB3_AIRGAP_MODE="true"
export ALCUB3_OFFLINE_DAYS="30"

# Configure local model storage
export ALCUB3_MODEL_CACHE="/secure/models/"
```

## Authentication & Access Control

### PKI/CAC Configuration
1. Configure hardware security module (HSM)
2. Import trusted certificate authorities
3. Enable two-person integrity checks
4. Implement session timeout policies

### Role-Based Access
- Define roles based on clearance levels
- Implement least privilege principle
- Regular access reviews (quarterly)
- Automated de-provisioning

## Network Security

### Segmentation Requirements
- Separate networks by classification level
- Implement data diodes for one-way transfers
- Use encrypted tunnels for all communications
- Regular network penetration testing

### Firewall Rules
- Default deny all inbound
- Whitelist required outbound connections
- Log all connection attempts
- Regular rule audits

## Monitoring & Incident Response

### Real-Time Monitoring
- Enable MAESTRO L1-L7 monitoring
- Configure alert thresholds
- Implement 24/7 SOC integration
- Automated threat correlation

### Incident Response Plan
1. **Detection**: Automated alerts, anomaly detection
2. **Containment**: Automated isolation, emergency override
3. **Eradication**: Threat removal, system hardening
4. **Recovery**: Validated restoration, monitoring
5. **Lessons Learned**: Update defenses, documentation

## Secure Development

### Code Security
- All code must pass SAST/DAST scanning
- Mandatory security code reviews
- No hardcoded credentials or secrets
- Regular dependency vulnerability scanning

### Deployment Security
- Use signed containers only
- Implement runtime security monitoring
- Regular security regression testing
- Automated compliance validation

## Compliance Validation

### Continuous Compliance
- Daily STIG compliance scans
- Weekly NIST control validation
- Monthly penetration testing
- Quarterly security assessments

### Audit Trail
- Immutable audit logs
- Cryptographic log integrity
- 7-year retention policy
- Regular audit reviews

## Emergency Procedures

### Emergency Override
```bash
# Emergency system shutdown
alcub3 emergency-stop all --confirm

# Isolate compromised component
alcub3 security isolate --component=<name> --reason="compromise"

# Initiate incident response
alcub3 security incident --severity=critical --notify=soc
```

### Recovery Procedures
1. Verify system integrity
2. Restore from secure backups
3. Re-validate security controls
4. Resume operations with monitoring
