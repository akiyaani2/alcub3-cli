3. **Technical execution** - Prove performance benchmarks vs. existing solutions
4. **Strategic partnerships** - Leverage rather than compete with defense primes

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Start with MCP integration use case (proven demand)
- Build modular architecture (reduce integration complexity)  
- Focus on single customer success story (prove market value)
- Maintain technology lead through continuous R&D investment

**Bottom Line:** Compression transforms Alcub3 from "MCP platform" to "defense AI efficiency platform" - a significantly larger and more defensible market opportunity.
