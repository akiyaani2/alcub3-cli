# Physics Validation Engine

## Overview
The ALCUB3 Physics-Aware Safety Validation Engine is a real-time physics simulation layer designed for defense-grade robotics command validation. It ensures that all robotic commands adhere to kinematic constraints, environmental safety parameters, and prevent dangerous movements.

## Key Architectural Decisions
- **Real-time Physics Simulation**: Designed for sub-10ms validation per command.
- **Kinematic Constraint Checking**: Validates all joint movements against defined limits.
- **Environmental Collision Detection**: Incorporates 3D spatial modeling for collision prediction.
- **MAESTRO Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with the existing MAESTRO security framework for audit logging and threat assessment.
- **Patent-Defensible Algorithms**: Utilizes unique algorithms for physics-aware safety validation.

## Patent-Defensible Innovations
- Real-time physics simulation for robotics command validation.
- Kinematic constraint enforcement with joint limit validation.
