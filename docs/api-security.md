# API Security

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-07-07
**Feature Status:** Implemented & Production-Ready (Task 2.8)

## 1. Overview

The ALCUB3 platform exposes a set of secure REST APIs for programmatic interaction. These APIs are designed to be secure, high-performance, and easy to use. They are the primary interface for integrating ALCUB3 with other systems and for building custom automation.

This document provides an overview of the security features of the ALCUB3 API.

## 2. High-Performance Architecture

The ALCUB3 API is built on a high-performance FastAPI architecture. This provides several advantages:

*   **Low Latency:** The API is designed to meet the demanding performance requirements of defense and critical infrastructure applications, with typical validation overheads of less than 100ms.
*   **Asynchronous I/O:** The use of asynchronous I/O allows the API to handle a large number of concurrent requests without blocking.
*   **Scalability:** The API is designed to be horizontally scalable, allowing it to handle very high request volumes.

## 3. Authentication & Authorization

The ALCUB3 API uses a robust, multi-layered approach to authentication and authorization.

*   **API Key Authentication:** All API requests must be authenticated with a valid API key. API keys can be created and managed through the ALCUB3 CLI.
*   **MAESTRO Crypto Integration:** The authentication system is tightly integrated with the MAESTRO cryptographic foundation. All authentication tokens are cryptographically signed and verified.
*   **Clearance-Based Access Control (CBAC):** Once authenticated, all API requests are subject to the same Clearance-Based Access Control (CBAC) checks as interactive commands. This ensures that API users can only access the data and tools that are authorized for their clearance level and role.

## 4. Input Validation

The ALCUB3 API uses JSON Schema to rigorously validate all incoming requests.

*   **Strong Typing:** All API endpoints have a strongly typed schema that defines the expected format of the request body.
*   **Security Focus:** The validation schemas are designed to prevent common API vulnerabilities, such as injection attacks and improper data handling.
*   **Robust Error Handling:** If a request fails validation, the API returns a detailed error message that explains what went wrong.

## 5. Logging & Auditing

All API requests are logged and audited.

*   **Structured Logging:** The API uses the Winston logging library to produce structured, machine-readable logs.
*   **Classification-Aware Sanitization:** The logging system is aware of data classification. It automatically sanitizes logs to prevent the leakage of sensitive or classified information.
*   **Comprehensive Audit Trail:** The logs provide a complete audit trail of all API activity, including who made the request, what action they performed, and what the outcome was.

## 6. Production Hardening

The ALCUB3 API is hardened for production use.

*   **CORS:** The API implements Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) to control which domains are allowed to access it.
*   **Rate Limiting:** The API implements rate limiting to protect against denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.
*   **Payload Limits:** The API enforces limits on the size of request payloads to prevent resource exhaustion.

By providing a secure, high-performance, and well-documented API, ALCUB3 enables organizations to safely and efficiently integrate the platform into their existing workflows and to build custom automation on top of it.
