# Secure Key Management & Rotation

## Overview
This document details the implementation of ALCUB3's secure key management and rotation system, ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of cryptographic keys across the platform.

## Features
- **Automated Key Rotation**: Patent-pending system for automatic key rotation based on predefined policies.
- **Classification-Aware Key Lifecycle Management**: Keys are managed according to their associated data classification levels.
- **Air-Gapped Distributed Key Escrow**: Securely store and retrieve keys in air-gapped environments.
- **FIPS 140-2 Level 3+ Compliant Storage**: Ensures keys are stored in a hardware-secured, tamper-evident manner.
- **Real-Time Key Health Monitoring**: Continuously monitors key usage, entropy, and integrity.
- **Zero-Trust Key Validation**: Validates key authenticity and authorization for offline systems.

## Performance
- Key generation: <50ms
- Key rotation: <200ms
