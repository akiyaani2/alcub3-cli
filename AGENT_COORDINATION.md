1. RESEARCH.md Consolidation:
   /RESEARCH.md
   ├── Defense AI Landscape Analysis
   ├── Patent Landscape Research
   ├── Competitive Intelligence
   ├── Technology Trend Analysis
   └── Reference Architecture Studies

2. Integration Points:

- Feed research directly into strategic planning (Agent 5)
- Update existing documentation rather than creating new files
- Use structured research summaries with actionable insights
- Link research findings to specific tasks/innovations

3. Research Workflow:

- During Research: Update RESEARCH.md with findings
- Upon Completion:
  - Summary report to Agent 5 for strategic integration
  - Key findings integrated into relevant technical docs
  - Archive detailed research in structured format
  - No standalone MDs for individual research topics
