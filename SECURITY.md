# ALCUB3 Security Policy

## Security-First Development

ALCUB3 is a defense-grade AI security platform built with security as the foundation, not an afterthought.

### Core Security Principles

1. **Zero Trust Architecture** - Every component assumes breach and validates continuously
2. **Defense in Depth** - Multiple layers of security controls (MAESTRO L1-L7)
3. **Air-Gap Ready** - Full functionality in disconnected environments
4. **Classification Aware** - Handles UNCLASSIFIED through TOP SECRET data

### Security Architecture Layers

- **L1 - Foundation**: Model security and integrity verification
- **L2 - Data**: Classification-aware data handling and encryption
- **L3 - Agent**: Sandboxed execution and behavioral monitoring
- **L4 - Deployment**: Infrastructure hardening and supply chain security
- **L5 - Observability**: Real-time threat detection and response
- **L6 - Compliance**: STIG, FISMA, NIST 800-171 automated validation
- **L7 - Ecosystem**: Multi-agent coordination and trust propagation

### Reporting Security Issues

**DO NOT** create public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.

Contact: security@alcub3.ai (coming soon)

For now, security issues should be reported directly to the development team through secure channels.

### Security Requirements

- All code must pass security regression tests before merge
- Security reviews required for all PRs touching security components
- Automated security testing on every commit
- Quarterly third-party security assessments

### Compliance

ALCUB3 maintains compliance with:
- NIST 800-171
- CMMC Level 3
- FedRAMP Moderate (in progress)
- DoD STIG guidelines
