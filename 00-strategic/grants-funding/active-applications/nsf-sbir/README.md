## Project Title

"ALCUB3: Universal Defense-Grade AI Security Platform for Critical Infrastructure Protection"

## Technical Innovation

### Problem Statement
Critical infrastructure faces unprecedented cybersecurity threats from AI-enabled attacks, while simultaneously needing to adopt AI for operational efficiency. Current solutions lack the security guarantees required for defense-grade deployments.

### Proposed Solution
ALCUB3 provides the first universal AI security platform with:
- 30+ day air-gapped operation capability
- Universal robotics security interface
- Neural compression for bandwidth-constrained environments
- Classification-aware processing (UNCLASSIFIED → TOP SECRET)

### Technical Objectives

**Phase I (6 months, $275K)**
1. Validate air-gapped MCP protocol in critical infrastructure
2. Demonstrate universal robotics security with 3 platforms
3. Achieve 40% compression with security preservation
4. Complete security certification requirements

**Success Metrics**
- Sub-50ms security validation latency
- 99.9% threat detection accuracy
- 40-60% bandwidth reduction
- Zero security breaches in testing
