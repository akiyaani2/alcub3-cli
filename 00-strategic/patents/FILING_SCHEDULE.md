## Strategic Considerations

### Patent Claim Strategy

#### Core Claims (File First)
1. **System Claims** - Overall architecture
2. **Method Claims** - Key processes
3. **Apparatus Claims** - Specific implementations

#### Continuation Strategy
- File broad claims initially
- Use continuations for specific implementations
- Reserve divisionals for unexpected prior art

### Geographic Filing Strategy

#### Phase 1: US Priority
- Provisional applications (all 106)
- Non-provisional conversion (selective)
- Track One examination for core 22

#### Phase 2: International (PCT)
- File within 12 months of provisional
- Designate: US, EU, UK, Japan, Korea, Israel
- National phase: Based on market traction

#### Phase 3: Defensive
- China, Russia (defensive publications only)
- Open source non-core implementations
- Standards body contributions
