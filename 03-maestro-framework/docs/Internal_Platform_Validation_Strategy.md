### **Issue: "Module not found" errors**
```bash
# Solution
export PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:$(pwd)/security-framework/src"
echo 'export PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:$(pwd)/security-framework/src"' >> ~/.bashrc
```

### **Issue: "AttributeError: SecurityClassification"**
```python
# In affected files, change:
from classification import SecurityClassification
# To:
from shared.classification import ClassificationLevel
```

### **Issue: Tests failing with timeout**
```yaml
# In config files, increase timeout:
timeout_minutes: 30  # was 10
max_workers: 8      # was 4
