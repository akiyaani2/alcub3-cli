## Overview

ALCUB3 implements a **defense-in-depth** security architecture that protects AI systems from the model level down to hardware. Unlike traditional security that bolts on protection as an afterthought, ALCUB3 integrates security at every layer.

### Key Principles
- **Classification-First**: Every piece of data has a classification level
- **Zero-Trust by Default**: Never trust, always verify
- **Air-Gap Ready**: Designed for 30+ days offline operation
- **Performance-Aware**: Security that scales with your needs

## Security Profiles

We offer three customer-centric security profiles:

| Profile | Target Customer | Security Level | Performance |
|---------|----------------|----------------|-------------|
| **ENTERPRISE** | Commercial/Industrial | Standard | <20ms overhead |
| **FEDERAL** | Government/Contractors | Enhanced | <100ms overhead |
| **CLASSIFIED** | DoD/Intelligence | Maximum | <500ms overhead |

See [profiles/README.md](profiles/README.md) for detailed comparison.

## Core Security Technologies

### 1. Classification System
**Purpose**: Prevent data spillage between security levels

Our patent-pending classification system automatically labels and tracks data sensitivity throughout the system:

```
PUBLIC → INTERNAL → PROPRIETARY → CUI → SECRET → TOP SECRET
```

**How It Works**:
- Every data object gets a classification label
- Labels inherit up (SECRET + UNCLASSIFIED = SECRET)
- Real-time validation prevents downgrade attacks
- Confidence scoring for automatic classification

**When It's Used**:
- ALWAYS - this is foundational to all security decisions
- Cross-domain data transfers
- API responses
- Robot command authorization

### 2. MAESTRO Framework
**Purpose**: Orchestrate security across all system layers

MAESTRO is not a security technology itself - it's the conductor that coordinates all other security components:

```
L1: Foundation Models Security (AI attacks)
L2: Data Operations Security (data poisoning)
L3: Agent Framework Security (agent isolation)
L4: Deployment Infrastructure (secure deployment)
L5: Evaluation & Observability (monitoring)
L6: Security & Compliance (policy enforcement)
L7: Agent Ecosystem (third-party security)
```

**How It Works**:
- Provides unified security API
- Scales features based on profile
- Coordinates responses across layers
- Enables defense-in-depth

### 3. Encryption Technologies

#### Standard Encryption (ENTERPRISE)
- **Algorithm**: AES-256-GCM
- **Use**: Data at rest and in transit
- **Performance**: ~2ms per operation

#### Quantum-Resistant Cryptography (FEDERAL/CLASSIFIED)
- **Algorithms**: Kyber (key exchange), Dilithium (signatures)
- **Use**: Protecting against future quantum computers
- **Performance**: ~10ms per operation
- **Note**: NIST-approved, ready today

#### Homomorphic Encryption (CLASSIFIED only)
- **Libraries**: OpenFHE, Microsoft SEAL
- **Use**: Computing on encrypted data without decrypting
- **Performance**: 100-1000x slower than plaintext
- **Example**: Process classified sensor data in untrusted cloud

### 4. Zero-Trust Architecture
**Purpose**: Continuous verification of all access

Traditional security: "Trust but verify"
Zero-Trust: "Never trust, always verify"

**Components**:
- Policy engine with machine learning
- Device trust scoring
- Continuous authentication
- Microsegmentation
- Least privilege enforcement

**How It Works**:
```python
# Every request goes through verification
if not verify_identity(user) or \
   not verify_device(device) or \
   not verify_context(location, time) or \
   not verify_authorization(resource):
    deny_access()
```

### 5. Hardware Security

#### HSM Integration
- **Purpose**: Protect cryptographic keys in hardware
- **Vendors**: SafeNet Luna, Thales, AWS CloudHSM
- **FIPS Level**: 140-2 Level 3 (FEDERAL) or Level 4 (CLASSIFIED)
- **Use**: Key generation, signing, encryption

#### Protocol Filtering Diodes (Air-Gap)
- **Purpose**: One-way data transfer across air gaps
- **How**: Hardware-enforced unidirectional communication
- **Use**: Getting data into classified systems safely

### 6. Byzantine Fault Tolerance
**Purpose**: Protect distributed systems from malicious nodes

Used in multi-robot operations where some robots might be compromised:
- Consensus among robots before critical actions
- Reputation system for trust
- Game-theoretic punishment for bad actors

### 7. Specialized Security

#### SROS2 (Secure ROS2)
- **Purpose**: Encrypted robot-to-robot communication
- **Features**: DDS security, access control, authentication
- **Use**: All ROS2-based robots in FEDERAL/CLASSIFIED

#### Air-Gap Operations
- **Purpose**: Complete network isolation
- **Features**: 30+ day offline operation, state reconciliation
- **Use**: Classified environments, contested areas

## How It All Works Together

### Example: Secure Robot Command Flow

1. **User Issues Command** "Move robot to coordinates X,Y"
   - Classification system labels command (e.g., SECRET)
   - Zero-Trust verifies user identity, device, and context

2. **MAESTRO Orchestration**
   - L1: Check for prompt injection attacks
   - L3: Verify command safety via agent sandboxing
   - L6: Ensure compliance with security policy

3. **Command Encryption**
   - Quantum-resistant encryption (if FEDERAL/CLASSIFIED)
   - HSM signs command for authenticity

4. **Transmission**
   - SROS2 secure channel to robot
   - Protocol filtering if crossing air gap

5. **Robot Execution**
   - Verify command classification matches robot clearance
   - Byzantine consensus if multi-robot operation
   - Execute with continuous monitoring

## Implementation Guide

### 1. Choose Your Profile

```python
from alcub3.security import SecurityProfile

# Commercial deployment
security = SecurityProfile("ENTERPRISE")

# Government contract
security = SecurityProfile("FEDERAL")

# Classified operations
security = SecurityProfile("CLASSIFIED")
```

### 2. Initialize Security

```python
# Security is automatically configured based on profile
await security.initialize()

# Verify configuration
assert security.classification.max_level == "CUI"  # For FEDERAL
assert security.crypto.quantum_resistant == True   # For FEDERAL
```

### 3. Secure Operations

```python
# Classify data
classified_data = security.classify(data, "SECRET")

# Encrypt with appropriate algorithm
encrypted = await security.encrypt(classified_data)

# Validate commands
if security.validate_command(command, user_clearance):
    await robot.execute(command)
```

## Performance Considerations

### Latency by Profile

| Operation | ENTERPRISE | FEDERAL | CLASSIFIED |
|-----------|------------|---------|------------|
| Classification Check | 1ms | 5ms | 10ms |
| Encryption | 2ms | 10ms | 50ms |
| Zero-Trust Validation | N/A | 20ms | 100ms |
| HSM Operation | N/A | 15ms | 30ms |
| **Total Overhead** | ~10ms | ~50ms | ~200ms |

### Optimization Strategies

1. **Caching** (ENTERPRISE/FEDERAL only)
   - Cache classification decisions
   - Cache Zero-Trust validations
   - Smart cache invalidation

2. **Batching**
   - Batch crypto operations
   - Batch HSM requests
   - Batch classification checks

3. **Async Operations**
   - Non-blocking encryption
   - Parallel validation
   - Background audit logging

### When to Use What

| Scenario | Recommended Approach |
|----------|---------------------|
| High-frequency sensor data | Batch classification, cache results |
| Robotic swarm coordination | Byzantine consensus only for critical decisions |
| Classified compute | Use homomorphic encryption sparingly |
| Cross-domain transfer | Pre-validate at source, use protocol diodes |

## Security Trade-offs

### What We DON'T Compromise On
- Classification integrity
- Cryptographic strength  
- Audit completeness
- Safety validations

### Where We Allow Flexibility
- Cache durations (per profile)
- Async vs sync validation
- Monitoring granularity
- Performance optimizations
