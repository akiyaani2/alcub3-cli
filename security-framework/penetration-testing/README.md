# ALCUB3 Penetration Testing Framework

## Overview
This framework is designed to provide automated and continuous security validation for the ALCUB3 platform. It will incorporate various techniques such as vulnerability scanning, fuzzing, and exploit simulation to identify and mitigate security weaknesses.

## Architecture
The framework will consist of the following core components:
- **Vulnerability Scanners**: Integration with industry-standard and custom-built scanners.
- **Fuzzing Engine**: For discovering vulnerabilities through malformed input.
- **Exploit Simulation Module**: To test the effectiveness of identified vulnerabilities.
- **Reporting Module**: For generating comprehensive security assessment reports.
- **Integration Layer**: To interface with ALCUB3 components and other security tools.

## Usage
Details on how to set up, configure, and run penetration tests will be provided here.

## Development Plan (Task 2.17 Subtasks)
1.  **Research and Select Core Tools**: Identify and evaluate open-source and commercial tools for vulnerability scanning and fuzzing.
2.  **Design Framework Architecture**: Define the modular components and their interactions.
3.  **Implement Basic Scanning Module**: Develop a module to perform basic vulnerability scans.
4.  **Develop Fuzzing Module**: Create a module for intelligent fuzzing of ALCUB3 interfaces.
5.  **Integrate Reporting**: Implement a reporting mechanism for test results.
6.  **Automate Test Execution**: Set up CI/CD integration for continuous security validation.
7.  **Develop Exploit Simulation (Future)**: Create modules for simulating known exploits.
