## ü§ñ My Role & Collaboration Context

As an AI assistant, my primary role is to accelerate development while adhering to stringent security and architectural standards.

- **Security-First Architecture**: Every change must prioritize defense-grade security with threat modeling before implementation
- **Patent-Defensible Innovation**: Flag new innovations and protect existing 37+ patent-pending technologies
- **Technical Excellence**: Target sub-second performance and 99.9% availability
- **Task-Driven Workflow**: Use Task Master for complex features requiring multiple steps
- **Current Focus**: Phase 3 Advanced Integration - K-Scale simulation, CISA compliance, neural compression

## üõ†Ô∏è Essential Commands

### Primary Development Workflow

```bash
# Run the full suite of pre-flight checks: clean, install, format, lint, build, typecheck, and test.
npm run preflight
```

### Individual Development Steps

```bash
# Build the TypeScript code to JavaScript
npm run build

# Start the ALCUB3 CLI for interactive use
npm start

# Run all unit tests using Vitest
npm test

# Run end-to-end integration tests
npm run test:e2e

# Check for linting errors
npm run lint

# Automatically fix linting errors
npm run lint:fix
```

### Running a Single Test

```bash
# Run a specific test file by its path
npm test -- packages/core/src/services/git.test.ts

# Run tests that match a specific name or pattern
npm test -- --grep "Authentication"
```

## ‚úÖ Task Management (Task Master)

Use the `task-master` CLI tool for features requiring multiple steps or complex planning.

- **When to use Task Master**: Multi-step features, complex refactoring, project-wide changes
- **When to work directly**: Quick fixes, single-file edits, simple questions

### Standard Task Master Workflow

1. **Create a task**:
   ```bash
   task-master add-task --prompt="Implement neural compression for MCP contexts"
   ```
2. **Break down the task**:
   ```bash
   task-master expand --id=<task_id>
   ```
3. **Work on the next task**:
   ```bash
   task-master next
   task-master show <task_id>
   # ...implement the changes...
   ```
4. **Update task status**:
   ```bash
   task-master set-status --id=<task_id> --status=completed
   ```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

ALCUB3 is a polyglot system designed for security and performance across 6 strategic pillars.

**Languages & Structure**:
- **TypeScript**: CLI & Core (`/packages/cli`, `/packages/core`)
- **Python**: Security framework, MCP server, robotics adapters (`/security-framework`, `/air-gap-mcp-server`, `/universal-robotics`)
- **Rust**: Performance-critical cryptographic operations

**Six-Pillar Architecture**:
- **Pillar 1**: Universal Security Platform Foundation (air-gapped MCP, agent sandboxing)
- **Pillar 2**: Universal Robotics Security Platform (Boston Dynamics, ROS2, DJI)
- **Pillar 3**: MAESTRO Security Framework (L1-L7 real-time monitoring)
- **Pillar 4**: Defense Simulation & Training (K-Scale Labs integration)
- **Pillar 5**: CISA Cybersecurity Posture Management (automated remediation)
- **Pillar 6**: Neural Compression Engine (40-60% compression with FIPS compliance)

**UI Architecture**: Terminal UI built with **React and Ink** in `/packages/cli/src/ui/` with React Hooks and Context for state management.

## üìú Development Guidelines

### **Security-First Development**

- **Threat Model**: Always consider security implications before implementation
- **Data Handling**: Assume all data is classified until proven otherwise
- **Classification Awareness**: Use provided classification services for all data operations
- **Dependencies**: All third-party libraries must be security-scanned
- **Testing**: Security test cases are mandatory for all new features

### Building and Testing

- **Pre-flight Check**: Always run `npm run preflight` before submitting changes
- **Testing Framework**: **Vitest** for unit tests, co-located with source files (`*.test.ts`)
- **Mocking**: Use `vi.mock()` for dependencies, place critical mocks at top of test files
- **Coverage**: Maintain high test coverage especially for security-critical components

### TypeScript Best Practices

- **Strict Mode**: ES2022 compliance with TypeScript strict mode
- **ES Modules**: Use `import`/`export` syntax
- **Type Safety**: Avoid `any`, prefer `unknown` with type-safe narrowing
- **Plain Objects**: Prefer `type`/`interface` over `class` syntax
- **Encapsulation**: Use module boundaries for API definition

### React (Ink) Development

- Use functional components with Hooks
- Keep rendering logic pure (no side effects)
- Never mutate state directly
- Optimize for React Compiler compatibility
- Avoid premature optimization with `useMemo`/`useCallback`

### Code Style & Review

- **Formatting**: Use Prettier (2-space indentation, single quotes, semicolons)
- **Comments**: Only high-value comments explaining "why", not "what"
- **Feedback**: All code review feedback goes to `FEEDBACK.md`
- **Conventional Commits**: Follow standard commit message format

## üéØ Current Development Focus

### **Phase 3: Advanced Integration** (Weeks 17-24)

**Immediate Priorities**:
- **Task 3.5**: Unified Robotics C2 Interface (fleet management)
- **K-Scale Defense Simulation**: Enhanced ksim integration with defense security
- **CISA Compliance Module**: Top 10 cybersecurity misconfiguration remediation
- **Neural Compression Engine**: Transformer-based compression for air-gap optimization

**Key Performance Targets**:
- Security validation: <1ms (achieved)
- Robotics integration: 100% success rate (achieved)
- Patent innovations: 37+ filed (target exceeded)
- Compression ratios: 40-60% (breakthrough achievement)

## ‚ùó Important Notes

- **Node.js Version**: Requires **Node.js 18+**
- **Sandboxing**: Enable with `GEMINI_SANDBOX=true` for security-critical operations
- **Authentication**: Supports Google accounts, Gemini API keys, and PKI/CAC for defense
- **Rebranding**: Forked from Gemini CLI - internal APIs may still reference "gemini"
- **Classification Handling**: All data operations must respect classification boundaries
- **Patent Protection**: 37+ innovations are patent-pending - document new innovations
- **Market Position**: First-mover advantage in $158.8B+ defense AI security market
- **Competitive Moat**: Only platform with air-gapped operations + universal robotics + neural compression
