MAESTRO Layer 2: Data Operations Security
Air-Gapped Data Security Implementation

This module implements MAESTRO L2 security controls for data operations
in air-gapped defense environments.

MAESTRO L2 Threat Landscape:
- Data Poisoning: Malicious data injection into training/inference
- Data Exfiltration: Unauthorized data extraction
- Data Integrity Attacks: Tampering with data in transit/storage
- Privacy Inference: Extracting sensitive info from model responses
- Data Lineage Attacks: Corrupting data provenance tracking

Patent Innovations:
- Classification-aware data flow controls
- Real-time data integrity validation
- Air-gapped data provenance tracking
